Please submit feature ideas in the discussions. I value your ideas.
This is written in LUA and is for computer craft tweaked, a minecraft mod that ads working computers. This OS aims to be as modular as possible and the installer only adds Installers for other modules and a startup script witch disables disk startup and auto-initiates the password lock.
